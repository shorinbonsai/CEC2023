Initial Graph: Ring with m = 2

The parameter settings are as follows: 
Number of sample epidemics: 5
Alpha: 0.3
Minimum epidemic length: 3
Re-tries for short epidemics: 5
Runs: 30
Mating events: 100000
Minimum degree for swap: 2
Population size: 1000
Number of vertices: 200
Maximum number of mutations: 4
Tournament size: 5
Decay strength for diffusion characters: 0.5

The file descriptions are as follows: 
best.lint -> the best fitness and it's associated data for each run
difc.dat -> the diffusion characters of the best graph for each run
run##.dat -> population statistics for each run
patient0.dat -> record of patient zeros
